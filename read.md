# Weekly Recap

### Promises in JavaScript

- A Promise helps manage asynchronous tasks like fetching data.
- It can be pending, fulfilled, or rejected and avoids callback hell.
- then handles success, catch handles errors, and finally runs code after completion.

### Async/Await

- Async functions return a Promise and make async code easier to read.
- Await pauses execution until a Promise is resolved, making code look synchronous.
- Using try...catch helps handle errors better.

### Node.js Web Server

- Node.js web servers handle HTTP requests dynamically.
- The http module allows creating basic web servers without extra software.
- A simple server needs to import http, create a server, define responses, and listen on a port.

## Summary

This week, I learned how to handle asynchronous tasks with Promises and async/await, and how to create a basic web server using Node.js. These skills help in building real-world applications efficiently.
