### Weekly Recap

- A Promise helps manage asynchronous tasks like fetching data.
- It can be pending, fulfilled, or rejected and avoids callback hell.
- then handles success, catch handles errors, and finally runs code after completion.
- Async functions return a Promise and make async code easier to read.
- Using try...catch helps handle errors better.
- Node.js web servers handle HTTP requests dynamically.
- The http module allows creating basic web servers without extra software.
